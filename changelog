cmark 0.7 (08 Jul 2023)

  * Update to cmark 0.30.3.
  * Allow text 2.
  * Remove benchmark suite.

cmark 0.6 (08 Apr 2019)

  * Update to cmark 0.29.0.
  * Export optUnsafe.  Note that the default is now to suppress
    potentially unsafe HTML; set optUnsafe to return to the old behavior.

cmark 0.5.6.3 (13 Mar 2019)

  * Use snoc instead of <> to add the null terminator.

cmark 0.5.6.2 (13 Mar 2019)

  * Ensure that withtext adds a null terminator (#14).
    This fixes a regression due to PR #13, which caused
    random content to appear in rendered TEXT nodes.

cmark 0.5.6.1 (11 Mar 2019)

  * Fix CString memory leaks (Anders Kaseorg).  The renderer functions return
  a malloc’d string which the caller is expected to free.

  * Fix use-after-free bugs (Anders Kaseorg).  `useAsCString` frees the
    CString after the IO action finishes executing, so passing `return` as
    that action can never be correct.  To make sure the CString gets freed
    at the right time, we need a “with”-style abstraction, not just a
    conversion function.  While we’re here replace this with
    `withCStringLen`, which also makes fewer copies.

  * Show node type on error for unknown node type.

cmark 0.5.6 (02 Aug 2017)

    attributes.
